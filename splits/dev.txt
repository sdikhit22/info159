290	F	Bad: I don't really know why this hotel has such a high rating. It's decent, but definitely not worth 3* and 300+ I paid for the room. Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking.
291	I	Bad: Nothing to dislike awesome stay. Good: Really liked the modern feel to the place ! Nice looking spot, so I kinda look like a bum when I travel so not to attract crime or Theves . And I usually travel around walking and exploring so I travel light aka bum looking ... the staff was very friendly to me . The room was awesome nice touches classical music playing after a shower and some music I was rejuvenated and went to the bar an had great conversation really a good memory to my trip I'd defiantly stay here again like the small hotel appeal . Great stay .
356	F	Good: Excellent location
452	F	Good: I really liked the water in the lobby.
179	I	Good: Close proximity to Freemont Street Experience.
427	I	Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient to airport, great staff, lovely decor.
249	F	Bad: It's not the hotels fault, but the sirens on the street woke me up. Good: The best bed I've slept in besides the one at home! Enjoyed all the pillows! Even though the hotel is older, the room was fine! The bathroom was generous, with a good shower.
445	F	Bad: quite a bit of noise from the upstairs 'neighbors.' They could do better with soundproofing... also, the breakfast was a bit weak. Eggs overcooked, somewhat tasteless and kind of cold, no specialty coffee drinks available and not much for healthy options. if you have a car, beware that for all intents and purposes the valet parking is required, and will run an extra 35/night. Good: lovely decor, super friendly and helpful bilingual staff. Bed was comfortable and the shower was good.
379	F	The staff was very helpful and friendly! Lenore was awesome! She delivered a bottle of champagne for our anniversary! Our ocean view room was wonderful and we are looking forward to staying again once the renovation is completed!The rooms were clean, but need some upgrading--But we were only in the room to sleep so it really didn't bother us...The mini fridge came in handy as well as the ABC Market a few steps away. Subway, Coldstone, Wolfgang Puck's are two minutes away walking...Sushi place within 5 minutes walking!!! McDonald's Burger King within 3 minutes walking...Check out the Pacific Hotel for some awesome cuisine and a huge aquarium!Thanks for making our 4th of July fun....Hey, everyone, don't forget to pick up the Entertainment Book for Hawaii...We saved a lot on Parasailing, Hiking, Snorkeling, Restaurants, Pearl Harbor, etc...Great two for one offers! I got mine on Ebay!
29	I	Excellent experience. Will come again and book stay in the future
274	F	Bad: Very expensive hotel relative to services eg Breakfast is repetitive and very weighted to carbohydrates. No skimmed milk, only half and half. Lounge area a little jaded, perhaps Remember to add in the tax etc as this significantly adds to the cost of the hotel. Good: The location is central to a range of must-see sights
228	I	Bad: safe is too small for dslr camera or laptop. not acceptable. Good: good location, good food, good price
257	F	Good: The hotel room was spacious and very comforting.....
382	F	The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations.
451	I	Bad: The staff never changed the sheets and I was there 4 nights. No microwave or refrig. Good: I like it was a min from the beach
438	F	Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!
482	I	Good: Great stay for short stay.
328	I	Good: staff was very friendly and accommodating, hotel perfectly located for travelers
167	I	Bad: Check out was too slow. Good: Buffet was excellent
14	F	Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!
395	F	I have stayed at the hotel several times over many years (while it was The Carlton). I am SO Very excited about this hotel for so many reasons. While I know there has been some challenges with renovations, I wish people would not get hung...More
280	F	Good: My wife and I stayed at the charlesmark for 4 days. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was a little small, but very clean and modern.
227	F	Good: The hotel is really beautiful! A little old, but clean and comfortable. The price is also good.
399	F	Bad: The mini bars are basic. I mean... if that's the only thing I can think of ...then this place is amazing. Good: Everything was perfect. Friendly staff, wonderful location, and they even had a whole setup with lounges on the beach that I was unaware of that was just perfect, too.
93	F	Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband. There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants. Very comfortable room and bed, neat layout for the closet and vanity, wonderful shower, cool design features (Vespa chair, red fridge, furniture).
474	I	Good: Excellent location, clean interior, very good staff. Easy check in/out. Free parking where the nearby hotels charge for parking even if you stay there.
171	I	Bad: access to parking. Good: the location
495	I	Bad: quiet off the strip but close enough to walk. Good: beds were very comfortable
252	F	Bad: The bathroom was gross. The inside of the tub was peeling.The ceiling looks as if it had a previous flood upstairs. Good: The buffet was good.The location of the hotel was great.
33	I	It was a great stay
315	F	Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building.
150	F	Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs. Definitely will return.
292	I	Bad: Price did not fit the size of the room. It felt more like a cubicle. Good: The room was nice and clean, came with safe, and fridge.
456	I	Good: Amazing hotel.good location.very clean.friendly staff.
377	F	When you read the information about Lenore, believe it. She is the bright and shining asset to this hotel. The staff are very personable and helpful. The rooms definitely need some upgrading. The location however is wonderful.
121	F	Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston.
460	I	Bad: everything ok. Good: all good
30	I	heat in room did not work properly, tv remote was broken excessive noise
263	I	Bad: Nothing . Good: Really nice casino brew pub hotel rooms were massive and clean great location for fremount street and affordable drink and food prices easy to get to the strip using local transport
420	I	Bad: THE BATHROOM WAS ON THE SMALL SIDE...PROBLEMS CONTINUALLY WITH THE TV / CABLE RECEPTION...HAD TO CHANGE ROOMS ON MY 3RD NIGHT BECAAUSE THE AC WENT OUT...VERY ANNOYED ABOUT THAT..BUT...OH WELL...
168	F	Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!
479	I	Bad: Restaurant was bad. Good: Thank God for the Starbucks
261	I	Bad: Street noise. Good: Decor, table games, dining
8	F	I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming. When I wanted to order room service I was told it was too late however, Olivia at the front desk informed me of a Italian... More
450	F	Bad: The small breakfast was offered at an additional cost. It had limited items for a vegetarian diet. Good: I was impressed with the complementary robes and slippers and not to mention the decor is as beautiful in person as it is online!
428	F	Bad: The bathroom was extremely tiny although had a good sized shower. Good: The location was excellent being a short stroll to a beautiful beach, near the historic art deco buildings and many good restaurants. The bedroom was large with a very comfortable bed. Interesting , different artwork throughout the hotel. Good variety of food at breakfast
194	I	Bad: No business center..wifi wasnt free..it asked for ten bucks...the internet kiosk was 650 for 30 mins..but deducted 20 mins to print boarding passes and no shuttle to airport. Good: Location
304	F	Bad: Bed is too small for two people and the blanket is too thin. The staff are just ok not very friendly though. Good: Location and the New England style building and the room is cute.
352	F	Good: Staff was wonderful! The location perfect. Nice breakfast
22	I	The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.
191	I	Bad: Nothing. Good: Location on Fremont
119	F	Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms.
343	F	Bad: Room size, bed size and breakfast. Good: Location is very good
124	I	Bad: Room was small. Good: Free apples and fruit Infused Water in the lobby. Free bikes.
488	F	Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable.
410	F	Good: Very friendly staff. Rental of a beach chair and umbrella was included in the room price.
11	I	Very friendly staff, great free breakfast items each morning, room and facilities very clean, staff superb! We had a problem with the heating system in our room and they had someone fix it within minutes! Would highly recommend this location/hotel.
70	F	If you don't mind staying out of town, the Fairmont Grand Del Mar is a top quality choice for San Diego located about 25 minutes north of the airport. It is a large traditional colonial property, with a beautiful golf course on the west side of the grounds, ample parking, equestrian facilities and a good spa (which has the best... More
373	F	Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there
444	I	Bad: I stayed at this hotel for 2 days..they asked me to pay 100 deposit even though I did not know that I had to spit this money before booking the room I finally agreed and in good faith and i paid I was told that the money will be returned back to my account within 7 working daysand so it was done for 1 month and the money I did not get back.
466	F	Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line.
394	F	I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area.
307	I	Good: Bathroom was large and the speakers in the wall
155	I	Bad: Thumping music all night long. So loud the windows vibrated.
221	I	Bad: the noise fm the live bands when trying to sleep.
60	F	We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this breathtaking luxurious resort. The hotel is well kept and boasts caring and attending staff that do their best to make your stay memorable. The hotel offers great rooms, amenities and activities for all ages. I fell and fractured my hand on the last day of our stay (off property) and the... More
375	F	This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.
222	I	Bad: Might need a little updating. Good: Conveniently located on Fremont
47	I	Better with more extras like breakfast. Preferred place to sleep for conference.
201	F	Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good.
340	F	Bad: Breakfast was not very large for the price of the hotel. Good: Everything about this place was great!
383	F	I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)
193	I	Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price.
143	I	The bed was uncomfortable It was close walking distance to everything
365	F	Bad: Bed was a bit hard. Breakfast was all carbs, but was better than nothing. Good: Great location, right near two T stops and directly across from the Boston Public Library. Super nice staff. Great bar downstairs. Great price. We loved having music speakers overhead in main room and bathroom. Roomy, hot shower with great water pressure. Free continental breakfast with good coffee.
169	F	Bad: This room is straight out of a horror film. Good: I like Fremont st
311	I	Bad: Room too small. Late check in at 15:00. Good: Excellent location and the staff was super polite. WiFi was working good. Check out at 12:00 was very convenient for me. Storage area provided.close by the center with all lot of coffees and bars around.
387	F	I really like the trip to Hawaii, and I think that everybody in the hotel was really nice to us in every think, the rooms were really clean, the breakfast were good too, and all the people help me when I had a question. I would come to the same hotel if I'll return to Hawaii. It was a really good experience.Ana
45	F	I was really disappointed with the TV service. Very few channels and poor quality.
490	F	Good: I was mistakenly booked the wrong date to extend my stay using Booking.com. However, the receptionist, Ms. Lynn, very helpful by giving a call to Booking.com and finally be able to change the date.
322	F	Bad: The room was very small and dark. Bathroom was large. The window faced an alleyway. Good: Amazing location and great price, clean room and nice staff.
237	I	Bad: needs to be updated a bit forsure. Good: i like that they upgraded our room for one night the beds were very comfy and staff were great and we felt very safe after what happened
207	F	Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised. Good: The location is great, easy access to all of Fremont area with a short walk. Not being a giant casino you don't have to walk far from the car or through the place to get out.
13	F	This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return.
430	F	Bad: Air conditioning wasn't working when we arrived, but the maintenance person fixed it. Good: Location friendly staff.
268	F	Bad: Had some trouble regulating the water temperature in the shower. Good: The use of space was excellent and the room and the bed very comfortable.
358	I	Bad: Nothing. Good: It's economical, boutique style (my fave), great quality in an A+ location for Boston visitors.
293	I	Strange drainage smell when entering the reception area Loved the location and friendly staff
94	I	Bad: Intermittent barking dog!. Good: Spacious suite, recommend end room on high floor
357	F	Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!
235	F	Bad: Room was a lot smaller than I expected, and seemed a bit rundown. Not to mention we were supposed to be on a floor that was nonsmoking. The floor smelled of a smoking lounge. Good: Location and staff were awesome. Had a great view of Freemont street from our room.
431	I	Bad: paying extra for Valet Parking. Good: The Kings room
74	F	To date, this takes the prize. It did not overwhelm me but I was, over the four days I stayed, consistently well served and impressed at the degree of detail that was maintained in every aspect of the experience. In the same way that the hotel service was a consistently delivered, high degree of service, without being over the top,... More
212	I	Bad: When we left there was a valet parking worker that made us put are luggage on the cart. But other than we had an awsome time there. Good: The location and the restaurants were great I enjoyed the buffet!
36	F	Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service.
342	F	Good: An excellent concierge.He thought through problems and gave you an informed choice of solutions.
233	I	Bad: Hassle checking in confirmation email lost by bookings or Fremont hotel had my email almost didn't use mine scary .
42	F	I loved my stay VIP service all the way. I didn't want to leave. I can honestly say I will visit again. I give it 5 stars
429	F	Bad: room 222 is directly below the fitness center and it gets very loud when someone is on the treadmill. Good: Devon at the front desk was a phenomenal host! He went above and beyond to make our stay great!
32	I	Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub.
