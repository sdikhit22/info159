309	F	Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean. I loved the exposed brick throughout the halls, and that actual keys are given out, not key cards. Great location and staff.
254	I	Good: The location was easily accessible to any downtown activities and the strip, we went to the pinball neon museum and the fremont street experience in one day. It was great
407	I	Good: Best Location SouthBeach, nice staff!
336	I	Bad: Breakfast was inadequate, no protein. Small bathroom. No luggage cart. Good: Location and discount parking. Clean with nice staff. Near subway station and Newbury St. with lots of good restaurants within walking distance.
205	I	Bad: The pool was not at the hotel had to go to another hotel to swim and that is not stated when your booking your room. Just make it clear that there is not a pool at the hotel other than that loved the hotel!. Good: Great place to stay
294	I	Good: great location breakfast
312	F	One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices.
326	I	Bad: Breakfast.
414	F	Bad: The bedsheeet was not really clean when we checked in. Good: Nice location, and I loved the bed so much it was so comfortable. The receptionists were really helpful and friendly.
306	I	Bad: Heater didn't work, so the room was very cold. Room wifi was crazy slow, so I couldn't use it AT ALL. Staffs were lazy and rude, especially when they call. Good: Location. Center boston
2	F	We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.
320	F	Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life
34	F	My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!
498	I	Bad: 25 resort fee when we did not use the facilities. Good: Clean,comfortable, location and clean
230	I	Bad: rooms are dated, not as clean as I like. casino is crowded - too many machines.
165	F	Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience.
123	I	Bad: Room size. Good: The close proximity to TD garden
187	I	Bad: Small restroom. Good: Clean room with a great view.
467	F	Bad: Nothing!. Good: 1.Great location, although 1 block back from the strip it is very central and perhaps better than staying on the strip to the far left or right. 2. Value for money for the size and comfort of the room 3. Short walk from hotel room to lobby entry unlike most mega hotels in Vegas 4. Small bar/casino across the road with 1 beer... unheard of on the strip
267	I	Bad: Beds were very hard and lumpy, rooms and hallways smelled of smoke and the AC cooled barely. Good: Ease of access to multiple things, great places to eat.
66	F	This resort is GORGEOUS!! Check in was perfect our room wasnt ready (we were there early) so they took my phone number while we had drinks by the pool and in 20 mins or so our room was ready! The next day we had spa appts and the receptionist heard it was our honeymoon trip so after our massages we... More
297	F	Bad: Tiny grim, room with a full size bed for my husband and myself which was way too small.If you opened the window ( onto an airshaft) the food smell from the neighboring restaurant were terrible. Good: the location
196	F	Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking.
213	I	Bad: Rude staff. Cleaniness. Bed. Had to change rooms three times. I will never stay there again!. Good: Nothing
178	I	Bad: Not sure about deluxe room i was in. Good: Location
73	F	We had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont! This is an excellent hotel, with great attention to detail including hotel grounds, architecture, amenities and staff. Service is first class and natural, you are made to feel very welcome. Great looking golf course, and plenty of other activities to enjoy such as walking, the pool, tennis. Or just relax in the... More
319	F	Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future
19	I	Just stayed one night but very happy. Nice, comfortable top floor room. Staff could not have been more helpful. Great location right by the Power Light district. Be prepared to pay for valet parking. Price of this was Offset though by free wine and cheese reception.
391	F	We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT
349	F	Good: Coffee and juice were nice to start out the day with! Cold cereal would have been a plus.
405	I	Bad: Was a bit pricey, but may be that was the season and the timing (March 17, it was a music festival at Miami Beach). Good: Very clean and stylish. Very helpful staff.
390	F	We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!
148	I	Bad: Buffet food.
43	I	The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)....
440	I	Bad: very small room and bathroom, noisy AC. Good: excellent staff and service, very friendly and accommodating, good location on Ocean Drive
131	I	Bad: Room too small and ice machine broke nice too small rooms. Good: Free water and apples
461	F	Good: It was a great location and had amazing decor.
388	F	Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience. Were glad you enjoyed our close proximity to our famous Kuhio Beach, restaurants, shopping outlets, and tourist attractions We are dedicated to touch all we encounter with integrity and the gracious spirit of Aloha as we fulfill the dreams of our guest. Overall we hope you had a positive experience on Oahu, and enjoy all the adventure our island has to offer. If your travels bring you back to Waikiki, we would be delighted to host you again. Mahalo,Thomas Harris Jr. General Manager
400	I	Bad: a pool would be a plus.the bathroom was too little. Good: the room was comfortable and excellent location. Good value for the money
316	F	Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.
15	I	Old hotel with many remaining architectural charms and most modern amenities. The staff is exceptional: friendly and very accommodating. Has a little bit of the wear tear around the edges associated with an historic building but remarkably clean. Passed the allergy test.
381	F	Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.
269	F	Good: Courteous and helpful staff! Excellent location. Close to prudential and shopping. Highly recommend
135	F	Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner.
299	F	Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great. Would have also preferred tea/coffee in the room rather that the large stereo/DVD system but that's just personal preference. Good: Great location, and friendly staff. Nice bar.
351	F	Bad: Breakfast can be better. Its very simple, I had to go out and seek for a real breakfast because the hotel option was not attractive at all. Good: Very good location. Our room was good, you get what you pay, anything more.
458	F	Bad: Rooms are a little compact, but that had little impact on our stay!. Good: Location was excellent and the price was very reasonable compared to other properties. Staff were all amazing.
483	F	Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip.
3	I	Currently in bed writing this for the past hr 1/2 there have been dogs barking and squealing call the front desk to advise basically to be told there's nothing they can do. 315.00 and I can't sleep.
421	F	Good: Location is just excellent! And the fact that they provide you included sunbed at the beach!
284	F	Bad: Maybe it was just my room but the fridge was kind of hard to reach. Good: I loved the room I was in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the room was quite cozy. The location was perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again.
406	I	Good: Courtesy, friendliness of employees. Perfect location.
418	F	Bad: The bathroom toilet area is tight. Would not probably be comfortable for larger person. You can hear through walls bit isn't much of an issue as probably will not be in room most of time. Good: Great location to beach and bars/restaurants. Convenient beach service as related to provided towel, chair, and umbrella service. Very good happy hour prices as related to that areas prices.
20	F	Everything was sold out in State College for Garth's concerts and the Inn came up as available...what an amazing find!! I'll be making the drive now each visit, just to stay there! The Inn is wonderfully decorated and I so enjoyed browsing all the books. Breakfast was amazing each morning. Thank you Stephanie and team!!
184	F	Bad: The beds were not too comfortable. Good: I really liked its location, and slot machines, the Paradise Buffet, and Duncan Donuts place within the Fremont Hotel.
92	F	Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!
423	I	Bad: Its not something i didn't like, its more like a recommendation since its not something quite important, and actually i don't know if other rooms have it but particularly my room didn't have a big mirror other than the one in the bathroom. Also, i think breakfast can be maybe until 11:30am, like other restaurants or hotel provide, more like a brunch style and serve more options. Good: Really modern hotel, very very clean room almost like if we were the first to use it, excellent staff. We arrived at 10am approximately since our flight was early in the morning and they managed to give us an available room. hotel is at an excellent location since its ocean drive but not at the crowded noisy part so we could party, and still be able to rest and sleep well!
289	I	Bad: Size of room. Good: Leaving
275	F	Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.
72	F	I love The Grand Del Mar in Del Mar California. This might have been my 6th time there. It is the only hotel in the area that i will stay at. It is truly a 5 star property. The staff is professional and very attentive. The rooms are very spacious, with marble bathrooms and separate shower and soaking tub. The... More
272	F	Bad: Rooms were pretty small, definitely not suited for a family but great for a couple. Good: Great location, Comfortable rooms, breakfast was good (beagles, cream cheese, donuts and coffee.)
271	F	Bad: The breakfast was minimal. The rooms were tiny. There wasn't a workout room. Good: The room location was at the back of the hotel and quiet.
283	I	Bad: Outlook from room. Good: Staff helpfulness Well designed use of limited space
468	F	Bad: I booked a room with city view but they said the only view is of the wheel. Good: The staff were helpful, comfortable beds and location.
199	F	Good: The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and well maintained
313	F	Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs.
362	I	Good: continental breakfast was great - and length of time offered was excellent. 24 hour desk personnel was a special plus and very helpful - at any hour. location is excellent - nothing better for shopping, restaurants, public transportation, sightseeing, etc. Close to everything you visit Boston for and great staff plus affordable.
82	I	Bad: Noisy in lower floors, but not at all at higher ones. Good: Very comfy beds, great lobby/bathroom
37	F	The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..
81	F	Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful. In short: STAY HERE!
126	I	Good: Its location.
404	F	Good: The staff was fantastic and amazingly helpful.
301	I	Good: I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet
158	F	Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days. The guy then said that in order for me to get my money back, I'd have to go through the third party that I booked the room through. Good: Nothing
96	F	Bad: A very minor quibble: only one side of the bed had a nightstand. Good: Room design was well thought out and executed, making an average-sized space especially user-friendly for a couple. Also, the room had more power outlets than I've ever seen in a hotel room. Staff was helpful and friendly, second-floor bar was very nice.
21	F	I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure.
426	I	Bad: Bathroom a bit small. Good: Good hotel. Close to beach and bars and restaurants. Good staff
160	I	Bad: That the tv would not switch to the input channel. I wasn't able to use the HDMI port on the TV. Good: The company I had with me. Lol
487	F	Good: I loved everything
128	I	Room too small and ice machine broke nice too small rooms Free water and apples
192	I	Bad: Rooms small, air conditioning don't work!!.
366	F	Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most.
419	I	Bad: The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min then 30 min for my vehicle to arrive. Twice the excuse given was the ticket inside vehicle was wrong.
282	F	Bad: One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Good: Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices.
106	F	Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.
211	F	Bad: Waitress didn't come around a lot even with tipping. The hotel was older and had some cosmetic problems. Good: Lots to around the property and decent food prices. The buffet was really good.
208	F	Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door.
334	F	Bad: The room was right off the elevator so you could hear everyone coming off of it. Good: The bathroom was very nice. The shower has great water pressure and the shower head is adjustable.
402	F	Bad: I didnt like being charged daily fees for the beach/pool when I never used them. Good: I was incorrectly being charged for the previous guests breakfast, its a good thing I checked my bill. I liked that the complaint was immediately checked and the bill promptly rectified.
397	F	It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last! From check in to check out we were treated courteously, even at the restaurant/bar where we had fun drinking fun drinks. Our room was beautiful...so NOLA and the marble bathroom and shower was perfect...LOVE Bienville House!!!
174	I	Bad: Bathroom was small, noisy outside. Good: Location, beds, price
486	F	Good: Friendly staff. Every thing was perfect.
371	F	Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind
493	F	Good: The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The location is away from the congestion of the strip but easily accessible. The Westin will be my first and only option when staying in Vegas.
481	F	Bad: No my experience was horrible it was a bad experience frome the moment we arrived to the moment we left. I had 6 rooms reserved 2 were canceled by hotel then when we asked questions the manager decides to to rais his voice at us to the point everyone on line to check in and around tje aria was able to here what was going on. My guest were unhappy they traveled from sacramento to vegas a 9 hour drive to vet bad service. Then vale was horrible my sisters car was broken into while on possession of vale instead of helping they yelled at her and dint help her. Ontop of that all my guest and I were separated and it was hard to meet up in my room they elevaters only alow access to your floor not others. Good: .

170	I	Bad: nothing!. Good: buffet is excellant! room are clean, great view of mountains and saw fireworks in distance.
113	I	Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden
239	I	Bad: The shower didnt drain. The pillows were horrible. My feet stuck to the carpet in the room. Good: Location
259	F	Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance.
454	F	Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!
