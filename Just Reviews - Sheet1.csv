Our experience at Rancho Valencia was absolutely perfect from beginning to end!!!! We felt special and very happy during our stayed. I would come back in a heart beat!!!
Amazing place. Everyone was extremely warm and welcoming. We've stayed at some top notch places and this is definitely in our top 2. Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.
"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again."
Currently in bed writing this for the past hr 1/2 there have been dogs barking and squealing call the front desk to advise basically to be told there's nothing they can do. 315.00 and I can't sleep.
I live in Md and the Aloft is my Home away from home...we stayed 1 night 7-7-16 ...Staff is great ! Especially Olivia who was Extra special because she remembered me by my voice over the phone ...which tells me she is very alert and pays attention to the customer their needs.AND SHE DID !

"I stayed here with my family for my daughters wedding. It had a very accommodating staff, Olivia was excellent. The rooms were very well maintained. Would highly recommend this hotel, especially if your wedding venue is Celebrations at the Bay!"
"Beautiful rooms and the nicest people working there. The front desk lady, Olivia, was extremely patient and helpful. We had lots of questions and she had just as many answers. The rooms were sleek and modern. The only thing that would make this hotel better would be free breakfast, but I really am asking for a lot. A++ stay. Thank... More"
"We stayed here while visiting Maryland Live!. Cute hotel in a great location. Clean, with a very modern look, upgraded bathrooms and amenities and super nice staff. Would definitely recommend and stay there again!"
"I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming. When I wanted to order room service I was told it was too late however, Olivia at the front desk informed me of a Italian... More"
"In my line of work, I use meeting space in hotels often. In my 15+ years of doing this work, this is the first time I've felt the undeniable pull to go out and write a hotel review, based solely on my meeting room experience. Though I did not use a guest room here, my colleagues who did shared that... More"
"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. Feels new, as if we were the first to stay there. Actually it is more opulent than I require. The free breakfast was good with sufficient choices including fresh fruit salad, eggs, bacon, bagels and pastries and more. It was a great location for our purpose:... More"
"Very friendly staff, great free breakfast items each morning, room and facilities very clean, staff superb! We had a problem with the heating system in our room and they had someone fix it within minutes! Would highly recommend this location/hotel."
"Upon arriving I see modern yet elegant decor which is pleasing to the eye. The front staff are very friendly. The room was clean including details, I'm talking no dust,no hair in bathroom-shower or beds which I tend to find in other hotels. Kudos to housekeeping. Sheets were crisp,beds were comfortable especially since this is a newer hotel. Breakfast in... More"
This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return.
"Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!"
Old hotel with many remaining architectural charms and most modern amenities. The staff is exceptional: friendly and very accommodating. Has a little bit of the wear tear around the edges associated with an historic building but remarkably clean. Passed the allergy test.
Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel.
Stayed here for second time recently. Gorgeous lobby. Friendly staff. Good free shuttle service. Our room this time was disappointing. King bed in too small space so that one side did not even have a lamp. Also the heating/cooling unit was right next to the bed and very noisy so we turned it off. Luckily it was not needed. Room...

"My husband and I always try to stay at the Hotel Phillips when we are in Kansas City. It is our favorite hotel and we have stayed at many. I feel at home there and the staff has always been exceptional, although we are not particularly demanding guests. Over the years we have probably spent at least 20 nights there.... More"
"Just stayed one night but very happy. Nice, comfortable top floor room. Staff could not have been more helpful. Great location right by the Power Light district. Be prepared to pay for valet parking. Price of this was Offset though by free wine and cheese reception."
"Everything was sold out in State College for Garth's concerts and the Inn came up as available...what an amazing find!! I'll be making the drive now each visit, just to stay there! The Inn is wonderfully decorated and I so enjoyed browsing all the books. Breakfast was amazing each morning. Thank you Stephanie and team!!"
I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure.
"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again."
"excellent location near convention center. friendly, willing staff. not a true luxury hotel in terms of the room I received, but a comfortable clean room, I didn't really need any more than that. After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel."
"Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!"
"Pros: the location is awesome, the room size is great, the bathroom is nice also with a nice tub. Bad: the style and furniture starts to get really old, no breakfast despite the high price, the price is high, nothing exeptionnal... We were 4 people and so 4 reservations. Unfortunately one was missing. It was 1am so very bad surprise.... More"
After getting the bait and switch I decided I'd rather stay anywhere else. I'm sure I wasnt missing much as it looks like project style crack house apartments. The front desk (old middle eastern lady) was extremely rude and up charged me 50 when I got there! I travel and stay in hotels 250 days/ year and trust me this... More
"We had no choice but to stay here when a tornado hit the area and most of Vineland was without power. They charged us 190 for one night, wouldn't accept my AAA card and after leaving, we found out, we had been charged for 4 cats (which we don't own) and for another person. It was only my husband and... More"
"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!"
Excellent experience. Will come again and book stay in the future
"heat in room did not work properly, tv remote was broken excessive noise"
"Even though we were having problems, i.e. Feather allergy, Flat tire, key not working...the front desk personell were always gracious and helpful."
"Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub."
It was a great stay
"My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!"
Free breakfast! Attentive staff Fantastic location
"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service."
The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..
THE LOCATION OF THE HOTEL WAS OUTSTANDING. BUT THERE IS AND ADDITIONAL COST FOR PARKING JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND . IF YOU PAY FOR PARKING AT THE TIME YOU CHECK - IN BE SURE TO HAVE IT OUT BEFORE 1 PM THE NEXT DAY
"was too quick, but very nice area"
"clean, good area, very kind crew, easy to park"
We had a great overnight trip to the National Harbor near DC. All of the sites and entertainment were within walking distance!
I loved my stay VIP service all the way. I didn't want to leave. I can honestly say I will visit again. I give it 5 stars
"The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)...."
"Convenient and comfortable. Staff is great, breakfast and WiFi is a bonus."
I was really disappointed with the TV service. Very few channels and poor quality.
"Awesome, Overall"
Better with more extras like breakfast. Preferred place to sleep for conference.
Very good experience. Staff was great. Enjoyed my times especially after my previous fiasco at that other hotel.
"The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!"
"Repeat trip to this hotel for national conference attendance. Provides a quality stay, business center kept me in touch and great value for limited travel budget."
I can't comment on the breakfast because we slept through it but everything else was excellent! I dont know why anyone would pay twice the price to stay at the Gaylord. 5 stars all the way!
Our room was a bit small. There was no microwave in the room. Location was more for couples than for family. The room itself And service were excellent.
"This hotel is a peach. The staff are friendly, the hot breakfast filling and the rooms are immaculate. This should be a poster child for how to run a hotel."
"Hampton Inn never disappoints. Always an affordable, clean hotel with attentive and friendly staff. The breakfast is always a plus too. Also, the National Harbor is a nice area full of shops and dining choices and seems to be a family friendly hangout destination for locals."
I stayed here with some friends for a convention. It was a good room and the free breakfast was nice.
"The hotel offers comfortable, somewhat elegant rooms but I suppose I was more impressed with the personnel and the warmth you get interacting with them. But for my phone call bills which seemed a bit high, my stay overall was great."
"We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area."
"Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent. Parking is 11 per day and that is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, at National Harbor 11 is not bad especially when Gaylord charges double of it per day."
"We hosted our annual Client Event at The Grand Del Mar and it was excellent!! The service, property, rooms, restaurants, and GOLF absolutely magnificent. Our conference managers were a gem, great service! Thank you for making an important event run so smoothly."
"We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this breathtaking luxurious resort. The hotel is well kept and boasts caring and attending staff that do their best to make your stay memorable. The hotel offers great rooms, amenities and activities for all ages. I fell and fractured my hand on the last day of our stay (off property) and the... More"

"This exquisite property located in the penasquitos canyon of North County is a spectacular retreat.

We drove down for a weekend getaway and to celebrate a special birthday. Our infant son accompanied us. The room was nice but the bathroom was fabulous.

This resort is GORGEOUS!! Check in was perfect our room wasnt ready (we were there early) so they took my phone number while we had drinks by the pool and in 20 mins or so our room was ready! The next day we had spa appts and the receptionist heard it was our honeymoon trip so after our massages we... More
The resort and staff are wonderful. The hotel is very nice and the groups are beautiful. The location is secluded so you need a rental car or to book the house car in advance. The concierge staff has not been to most of the spots so use trip advisor to help find the right places.
"This is a very, very, very good hotel. My expectations were high because of the reviews I had read and it didn't quite meet my expectations. I know I'm knit-picking but while the abundance of fresh flower petals in my room were very nice I would gladly have traded them for a room service breakfast with hot coffee, hot ham... More"
"Expensive Yes. Service Above the norm! Nickel and dime you on the small stuff Nope! (one of my pet peeves if you are going to stay at a hotel of this caliber) This property gives you 5 star service.

"To date, this takes the prize.

It's a great place to stay and leave a car if you are flying out. The courtesy shuttle takes 10 minutes to get to O'Hare.

Average hotel for decent price. It was balanced. Housekeeping did leave our door only ajar after cleaning one day. Arrrggghhhh!!!!! Nothing was missing.
The room key did not work i to go to lobby 4 times no parking under heavy construction noise the staff very incompetent I will not come back to this hotel
We Had the best time ever! r r What a ball we had at Clarion Resort Waterpark! r r The place was large enough to have plenty of rides but small enough to walk comfortably. r r The entire facility is NEW and all the rooms are well
"Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need."
"Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful. In short: STAY HERE!"
"Bad: Noisy in lower floors, but not at all at higher ones. Good: Very comfy beds, great lobby/bathroom"
Good: Staff went out of their way after checkout to locate an item I had left in the room. The room had already been cleaned and the staff got the item back to me as quickly as possible. Roof top bar was beautiful.
"Bad: A little bit of noise from the 'L' down below, but then again that is part of the character of the city. Good: Overall cleanliness, new feel, friendly efficient staff, great happy hour! Excellent location."
Bad: The room rate was terrible we had a Booking.com rate that was not honoured it soured the stay and was a big difference. We to date have no explanation!. Good: Location
Bad: Had a couple of glitches getting the room serviced but otherwise very friendly and helpful staff. Good: Great location. Nice rooms with exceptionally comfortable bed.
Good: A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in and around the hotel.
Would be nice if the duvet were in a duvet cover as I just get tangled between the flat sheets and the comforter Gym could really do with some more variety in terms of machinery - Its impossible to do much leg work as there is no squat rack with a bar - or even a smith machine which has multiple purposes Super helpful staff 24/7 - very accommodating of my unusual hours Room service menu is amazing Views are amazing Cerise Bar on the roof is epic and the bartenders are amazing I will be coming back and SOON!
Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.
Bad: Loved everything about Virgin Hotel. Good: First and foremost the staff - just wonderful. Friendly and very patient with all the enquiries we made! And we were there for the historic parade to celebrate the Chicago Cubs World Series win and the icing on the cake was another historic win - Ireland beating the All Blacks after 111 years!
"Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!"
"Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!"
"Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband. There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants. Very comfortable room and bed, neat layout for the closet and vanity, wonderful shower, cool design features (Vespa chair, red fridge, furniture)."
"Bad: Intermittent barking dog!. Good: Spacious suite, recommend end room on high floor"
"Good: The suite was very well apointed, plenty of room for an inroom breakfast --the bed and bedding were very nice. The staff couldnt be nicer We had a great night on the rooftop deck.... we never left the propertysmall plates a DJ and wonderful views. Ill be back"
"Bad: A very minor quibble: only one side of the bed had a nightstand. Good: Room design was well thought out and executed, making an average-sized space especially user-friendly for a couple. Also, the room had more power outlets than I've ever seen in a hotel room. Staff was helpful and friendly, second-floor bar was very nice."
Bad: The view. Good: Everything
"Beds were very comfortable, room amenities perfect. Enjoyed the lobby level coffee shop, roof top bar and happy hour on the 2nd level every evening. A great bonus!"
"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location."
"Good: I loved the quirkiness and style of the hotel. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. The drinks at the bar were top notch and the price for the location was unbeatable. And the bed, the bed was perfect. I slept like a baby."
Bad: I was supposed to get a room with two beds and ended up with a room with one full bed for me and my husband.it was very small!.
Staff weren't helpful and no one tried to come and clean our room on several nights. Rooms were very small. Good location
Bad: Cost of the valet. Good: Location to the garden
"Bad: (Valet) parking is expensive. Room was a bit small. Good: Very pleasant experience. The room was good, clean and had a rich minibar. Very nice bar/restaurant/breakfast accomodation. Personell (we were helped by luckas) was extraordinary kind and helpful."
Good: Beautiful rooms and amenities - L'occitane products. The restaurant Finch great food and amazing bar. Loved the Boxer
Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.
"Good: The room was very comfortable, great for a couple. We had a wonderful time, it was very conveniently located to the TD Garden, which is where we were attending a concert. It was also very close to the North End and Faneuil hall, which is a great area to visit for food options that are very plentiful."
the breakfast at 17 bucks was a bit of disgrace. it is a particular building.
"Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been. Came away from our 3 night stay (planned and booked 6 months earlier) just feeling like we had been let down . . . ."
Bad: poor room comfort no room for clothes very old bath accesories high price.
"Good: The whole 5 day experience at the hotel was superb- the room,staff and location were all perfect- thank you The Boxer second time staying with you and all requirements were met."
The location
Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden
Fitness center small and not well equipped. Good location.
Bad: Nothing. Good: The hotel was simply excellent. The coolest hotel I have ever stayed!
"I didn't like the size of the rooms, not as big as I thought they would be. I liked the central location to Downtown Boston."
"Good: Very quaint hotel, good location, great staff...amazing time!"
"Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else."
Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms.
Bad: Paying for parking. Good: Friendly and prompt service.
"Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston."
"Good: The hotel environment, the staff went above and beyond to make our first trip to Boston better than we expected. Recommendations they made, help with directions, very friendly, didnt feel like a hotel, felt like staying with friends. Comfortable beds, cozy room, great food."
Bad: Room size. Good: The close proximity to TD garden
Bad: Room was small. Good: Free apples and fruit Infused Water in the lobby. Free bikes.
"Good: A marvelous location, very friendly crew, it's clear hotel where you feel you are in Boston!"
Good: Its location.
Bad: The pull out couch was extremely uncomfortable. Good: Room was great. Staff was friendly and welcoming.
Room too small and ice machine broke nice too small rooms Free water and apples
the bed was very comfortable
"Bad: Sofa bed very uncomfortable. Good: Great restoration of classic building close to sports, shopping and financial district."
Bad: Room too small and ice machine broke nice too small rooms. Good: Free water and apples
"Bad: The pillows were very flat and uncomfortable, and there was no real blanket on the bed!. Good: Location, staff, aesthetics, price."
"Bad: I think the hotel could do more to promote the on site restaurant with newly arrived guests. My husband tried it and thought the food was great but if there'd been a deal or something to catch our attention I'm sure we'd have eaten breakfast there both mornings of our stay. I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests. Good: Very comfortable beds. Not massive but cosy and we all slept well. The linens were clean and fresh and we enjoyed the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful."
Bad: The room lacked hanging space and was quite small. Good: The staff were friendly and helpful. The bar and restaurant were nice
"Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner."
Good: The location was perfect for walking to everything
"Bad: Shower didn't drain propery, was puddle in shower when we checked in. Someone else's shower water left over, very gross. Good: Very friendly staff."
Bad: Room servicing late in the day. Good: Great hotel. Friendly staff.
Nothing Very friendly staff and very helpful
Bad: The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!. Good: The room was good
"Bad: the room was not very big and a couple more hooks here and there would have been nice to hang coat, towels etc. Good: nice decoration, well located"
Bad: Just want to say paying 330 for one night would have been nice too get breakfast included in the price. . Good: At least it wasnt too far from TD garden.
The bed was uncomfortable It was close walking distance to everything
"Good: Staff was great, room small but clean and organized well. Location to TD Garden and restaurants awesome."
Good: Perfect location if you're attending an even at the Garden. Very short walk
Good: Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.
Bad: The bed platforms! Perhaps if they were painted white they would become part of the bed and maybe missed a little more! They are now the colour of the carpet - beware!. Good: The staff! Very helpful and welcoming and happy! Loved the L'octaine toiletries. Free bikes were a good idea too but it rained during my visit.
Bad: Buffet food.
"Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town."
"Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs. Definitely will return."
Nice hotel with a great restaurant! Only thing that would have been nice to have it a bathtub rather than just a shower.
"Pros- Great customer service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, fantastic room style/decor and safe area. Cons- no pool, no meals available, just a few pastry type items at the bar/lobby"
"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect."
"Bad: Better return from the slots!!. Good: Bed excellent, pillows good, shower good with strong flow and hot. Very well maintained public spaces with lots of wood panelling. The piece of the Berlin Wall was quite interesting and all at a very good price."
Bad: Thumping music all night long. So loud the windows vibrated.
Bad: Losing money lol. Good: I like the attitude and service from the staff...i enjoy the atmosphere and the food
"Good: The staff at the place is extremely friendly.Paradise Restaurant buffet good selection, good food, and reasonable cost."
"Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days. The guy then said that in order for me to get my money back, I'd have to go through the third party that I booked the room through. Good: Nothing"
Good: HELPFUL STAFF
Bad: That the tv would not switch to the input channel. I wasn't able to use the HDMI port on the TV. Good: The company I had with me. Lol
"Good: Best gambling in Vegas and best comps! Brewery is great, rooms very clean, staff is wonderful. I only stay at Main Street."
Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!
"Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning"
"Bad: Dirty and old room. Valet parking is not comfortable. Casino is old and has no roulette. If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas"
"Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience."
"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees."
Bad: Check out was too slow. Good: Buffet was excellent
"Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!"
Bad: This room is straight out of a horror film. Good: I like Fremont st
"Bad: nothing!. Good: buffet is excellant! room are clean, great view of mountains and saw fireworks in distance."
Bad: access to parking. Good: the location
Bad: Very satisfied.
"Bad: The place was falling apart, the tub was cracked and broken. the bathroom shelf was barely holding on. The bed was extremely tough to sleep on. Good: I liked that it was close to entertainment. The shower held a hot water temperature for a long time."
"Bad: Bathroom was small, noisy outside. Good: Location, beds, price"
"Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff."
"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas."
Bad: smokey air out of elevators. Good: valet parking with security-
Bad: Not sure about deluxe room i was in. Good: Location
Good: Close proximity to Freemont Street Experience.
Bad: missed not having a pool or somewhere to sit out and read. we were next to the railway so the train was noisy but we got used to it. Good: loved the food. beds very comfortable. excellent value.
Bad: I lost roulette. Good: Buffet bb
"Bad: The bathroom needs to be upgraded. It is very worn, the brown wall paper was dirty and the paint on the sink counter was pealing off. was also disappointed the room did not have a coffee maker. I like to have a cup while I get dressed in the mornings. would have liked a non-smoking area in the casino. I am a non-smoker and I had to keep taking breaks and go outside for fresh air. Good: The Beds were great! The location was very good. The gentleman at the Registration desk was very helpful and friendly. And the Lady at the Keno lounge was nice too."
"Bad: Not so quiet during the night, since it's really close to highway. Good: The beds were very confortable. The parking was for free, and the location close the Fremont street."
"Bad: The beds were not too comfortable. Good: I really liked its location, and slot machines, the Paradise Buffet, and Duncan Donuts place within the Fremont Hotel."
"Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!"
Bad: Limited TV channels and no refrigerator or coffee making facility in room. Good: The free parking at the hotel was great and all the staff were very helpful and polite.
Bad: Small restroom. Good: Clean room with a great view.
Bad: Even though we got a non smoking room it still smelled like smoke. Good: Valet parking Duncan doughnut
"Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal."
Bad: It was hard to get into the parking area because of traffic (an event was going on) no coffee pot in the room. I like to sit and drink coffee for and hour or so before doing anything for the day. I'm not paying 3.00 per cup of coffee. Other than that it was ok. Good: It was a beautiful hotal
Bad: Nothing. Good: Location on Fremont
"Bad: Rooms small, air conditioning don't work!!."
"Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price."
Bad: No business center..wifi wasnt free..it asked for ten bucks...the internet kiosk was 650 for 30 mins..but deducted 20 mins to print boarding passes and no shuttle to airport. Good: Location
"Bad: I was in room 314, and its very noisy at night with the street ambiance, so dont expect to sleep before 2AM. I had to take my breakfast to adjacent hotels as continental / seated proper breakfast was not available (or couldnt find it...). Good: The bed was confortable and the location is just amazing on Fremont street."
"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking."
Good: Westin has always the most comfortable beds
"Bad: Th e food wasnt that good. Good: The breakfast buffett was good, the other 2 restaurants were just fair, in fact in one of them I got sick with the food."
"Good: The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and well maintained"
Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way.
"Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good."
Bad: Bed was not comfortable - they need to replace the mattress. Good: Room was clean.
"Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker."
"Bad: The bathroom is very small, smaller than I am used to. The saimin noodle soup at the cafe was terrible, the noodles were mushy and blend. Good: Location was right. The buffet was so so. The food at the cafe was okay. The rooms are kind of small but okay."
Bad: The pool was not at the hotel had to go to another hotel to swim and that is not stated when your booking your room. Just make it clear that there is not a pool at the hotel other than that loved the hotel!. Good: Great place to stay
"Bad: in old town, far away from new main strip noisy air-con in room decor abit old. Good: cheap buffet with good quality big room comfort bed"
"Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised. Good: The location is great, easy access to all of Fremont area with a short walk. Not being a giant casino you don't have to walk far from the car or through the place to get out."
"Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door."
Bad: My room was near the ventilation system and there was a lot a noise coming from that. Good: Excelent location in the freemont Experience.
Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care.
Bad: Waitress didn't come around a lot even with tipping. The hotel was older and had some cosmetic problems. Good: Lots to around the property and decent food prices. The buffet was really good.
Bad: When we left there was a valet parking worker that made us put are luggage on the cart. But other than we had an awsome time there. Good: The location and the restaurants were great I enjoyed the buffet!
Bad: Rude staff. Cleaniness. Bed. Had to change rooms three times. I will never stay there again!. Good: Nothing
"Good: Good hotel at Fremont street. But do not expect something special. Relatively old rooms, no WIFI in the rooms, but the bed was comfortable, the staff was nice, and the Hotel is direct in the heart of Old Las Vegas."
"Bad: Pricey, but it was fathers day weekend. Good: Access to downtown"
Bad: No pool. Good: Every thing was walking distance
"Bad: Dirty, tiny bathroom and no pool. Good: Prime rib meal deal at Roma's"
"Bad: A fridge in the room would be super nice. Good: The room was very clean, beds comfy and 3 pillows. Every one was friendly. Great valet staff."
Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient.
"Bad: I loved everything. The parking, the restaurant ,the rooms and the the several acts that perform every night in the downtown area. Good: The people at the front desk were superb. They upgraded me to a real nice room."
Bad: the noise fm the live bands when trying to sleep.
Bad: Might need a little updating. Good: Conveniently located on Fremont
Bad: Better meal choices. Pool and fitness center on property. Good: Ease of conveniece to everything I needed
Bad: That I had to leave great place. Good: Everything very nice room food service
Bad: There is handicap parking for checking in but not close after checking in. Good: Everything was convenient and costs of the buffet were not bad. Prices in the restaurant were affordable.
Bad: My money was stolen at the valet... room was dirty and had to get another then key card didn't work for new room. Manager did his best but I was disappointed. Good: Location
"Good: The hotel is really beautiful! A little old, but clean and comfortable. The price is also good."
"Bad: safe is too small for dslr camera or laptop. not acceptable. Good: good location, good food, good price"
Bad: The bar tender in the Casino was not at all friendly or attentive. Good: very nice restored hotel. Excellent condition. Great atmosphere. A very nice place to stay in Downtown Las Vegas
"Bad: rooms are dated, not as clean as I like. casino is crowded - too many machines."
"Bad: Not a thing. Good: The room was nice and clean, bed was very comfy. The restaurants were all great the Buffet was awesome.......... So much to do in the aera"
Bad: Shower Tub clogged. Good: Convenient location. Reasonable food prices. Awesome selection of cuisine. Helpful staff!
Bad: Hassle checking in confirmation email lost by bookings or Fremont hotel had my email almost didn't use mine scary .
Bad: Rude staff. Couldnt find our reservations waited 2 hrs to confirm eventhough prepaid..rooms not cleaned. Got smoking instead of non smoking. Will not be staying there anytime soon not. Good: Location
"Bad: Room was a lot smaller than I expected, and seemed a bit rundown. Not to mention we were supposed to be on a floor that was nonsmoking. The floor smelled of a smoking lounge. Good: Location and staff were awesome. Had a great view of Freemont street from our room."
"Bad: wifi is chargeable. Good: location, casino was cheap, food is just in the hotel (buffet, donuts, etc)"
Bad: needs to be updated a bit forsure. Good: i like that they upgraded our room for one night the beds were very comfy and staff were great and we felt very safe after what happened
"Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!"
Bad: The shower didnt drain. The pillows were horrible. My feet stuck to the carpet in the room. Good: Location
"Bad: Seemed old, our ac didnt work. Good: Location"
Bad: good. Good: yes
Bad: Smoking. Good: Not crowded
Bad: The ventilation system was not adequate for the building. Everything including room smelled like cigarette smoke. Good: restaurant
Bad: The room was hot the ac didn't work . the beds looked like full beds had to put both together . other than that everything else was fine. Good: It was nice staying at the Fremont loved going out to the street to see everything happening all the bands playing never did that before .
Bad: Valet scrapped my car on the wall and no fridge in the room. Good: It was clean and close to everything!
Bad: Non smoking rooms smelt like smoke and just all the cigerate smoke throughout hotel. And room drains slow draining. Good: I liked the lanai restaurant and valet parking
"Bad: The wait to enter the buffet was too long never got in the whole week.. When I went to the other restaraunt I was told I couldn't order certain items as they are for happy hour only so I left. They also did not have a pool or any alternative except travel 18 miles to their other facility and use their pool. They never even gave me a discount for lack of this facitilityor even notifying me as I made my reservation months in advance, I also did not like having to park outside of the parking garage only cause I was riding a motorcycle the parking garage was for cars only. I felt as though I was a second class citizen, no laundry facility service or machines . Good: The location was good and the staff especially the cleaning of my room was great."
Bad: Short staffed at the registration desk. Good: Great location and price was right
"Bad: It's not the hotels fault, but the sirens on the street woke me up. Good: The best bed I've slept in besides the one at home! Enjoyed all the pillows! Even though the hotel is older, the room was fine! The bathroom was generous, with a good shower."
"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas."
Bad: No self parking.. had to reach down to flush toilet. Good: Location
Bad: The bathroom was gross. The inside of the tub was peeling.The ceiling looks as if it had a previous flood upstairs. Good: The buffet was good.The location of the hotel was great.
Bad: We liked everything. Good: The beds were comfortable the rooms were clean
"Good: The location was easily accessible to any downtown activities and the strip, we went to the pinball neon museum and the fremont street experience in one day. It was great"
"Bad: Old outdated rooms, even though its a classic hotel does not mean they dont have to put forth effort to modernize rooms. Good: Was right in Fremont street"
Bad: One of the things we did not like was the fact that we couldn't wake up to a cup of coffee in the morning without paying an arm and a leg for one. The other was that they should at least offer free coffee and beverages to their customers. Washington State casino have a coffee and soda machines for their customers to enjoy as they play. I also do not like the idea of casinos shoving resorts fees down a person throat when they know that the percentage of customers do not use the resorts. Good: I enjoyed the friendly staff.
Good: The hotel room was spacious and very comforting.....
Bad: We hated the window were fake. Good: I liked the location the most
"Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance."
Bad: The bed was too soft for my mate and we need more pillows. They were happy to provide the additional pillows. Good: The entire staff was very nice. The room was clean and we stayed on the north-side and did not hear any noise from Fremont Street.
"Bad: Street noise. Good: Decor, table games, dining"
"Bad: No wifi in the rooms in 2017. Good: Great location! Friendly staff and you can buy your breakfast in the casino. There is no free Wifi in the rooms, but you can enjoy free Wifi in the lobby. Room was spacious enough and linnens were clean. Room looked like it was recently updated and we enjoyed our stay."
Bad: Nothing . Good: Really nice casino brew pub hotel rooms were massive and clean great location for fremount street and affordable drink and food prices easy to get to the strip using local transport
Bad: the entire atmosphere of being downtown Las Vegas. Good: Everything was very convenient to get to.
Bad: That I couldn't stay longer because of work. Good: All the lights and the view
"Bad: I guess the lack of facilities in the modern world. No pool, hot tub, gym. We got lost a few times walking down stairs, even went into their staff lounge and kitchen by accident. No free wifi anywhere! 10 a day per device.... Good: We loved being in the center of action and its great value. All the staff were very helpful."
"Bad: Beds were very hard and lumpy, rooms and hallways smelled of smoke and the AC cooled barely. Good: Ease of access to multiple things, great places to eat."
Bad: Had some trouble regulating the water temperature in the shower. Good: The use of space was excellent and the room and the bed very comfortable.
Good: Courteous and helpful staff! Excellent location. Close to prudential and shopping. Highly recommend
Bad: Breakfast was missing protein. Only bagels and donuts. Good: Location! Location! Location!
Bad: The breakfast was minimal. The rooms were tiny. There wasn't a workout room. Good: The room location was at the back of the hotel and quiet.
"Bad: Rooms were pretty small, definitely not suited for a family but great for a couple. Good: Great location, Comfortable rooms, breakfast was good (beagles, cream cheese, donuts and coffee.)"
"Bad: Breakfast pretty modest but I could leave with that!. Good: Excellent location next to attractions, commercial area, everything. Friendly and helpful staff. The room was not big but well equipped. Good price for Boston which is an expensive city."
"Bad: Very expensive hotel relative to services eg Breakfast is repetitive and very weighted to carbohydrates. No skimmed milk, only half and half. Lounge area a little jaded, perhaps Remember to add in the tax etc as this significantly adds to the cost of the hotel. Good: The location is central to a range of must-see sights"
Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.
"Bad: noisy room heater/AC unit. Good: location, small comfortable room."
"Good: Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast, nice to have a lounge to sit and read the newspapers provided. Stored luggage until we were ready to leave. Would stay again."
Bad: I didn't see that there was breakfast available at the hotel. Good: Location was amazing!!!! Room was a little tight for two but very nice
Bad: parking. Good: BREAKFAST AND THE BAR WERE REAL NICE........BARTENDER chris ..great guy
"Good: My wife and I stayed at the charlesmark for 4 days. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was a little small, but very clean and modern."
Good: Location is fabulous. Got there very early and was able to check in! Room was clean and modern. Love this hotel!
"Bad: One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Good: Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices."
Bad: Outlook from room. Good: Staff helpfulness Well designed use of limited space
Bad: Maybe it was just my room but the fridge was kind of hard to reach. Good: I loved the room I was in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the room was quite cozy. The location was perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again.
"Parking is available at a parking garage a few streets away if you use the one recommended by the hotel. The rate the hotel give you is not the lowest rate you can get, I parked at the same parking lot for less using a parking app. It is worth looking into this if you are driving. Secondly, make sure you try and get a room with a queen bed. The doubles are tiny and this was my only regret with staying at this hotel. The location of the property is excellent. Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay. No expense was spared in the room in terms of technology (had hard wired speakers even in the bathroom). Not sure they are needed, but was a nice touch. Rooms were clean, bathrooms small but had everything you need and was nice to have a shower not standing over a bath for once."
"Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there. The room size and the narrow hallways gave the entire place the European feel... nothing wrong with that, right. Good: 1. Outstanding location! Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6. Reliable cooling/heating system. 7. All the small details such as nice toiletry items, modern plumbing, detachable shower head, hairdryer, iron, a huge mirror... Thank you, CharlesMark! We hope to stay there again."
"Bad: Highly recommend. Good: Modern style, great location, super helpful staff, continental breakfast included, great value, clean"
"Bad: staff r not helpful at all, room was really soooooo tiny even I booked large room, but the staff gave me two options,, if I want the large room I booked,,,, I have to go up a stair with my luggages, then down a stair again with my luggage to the basement, then walk through a hall way to reach my large room,,, or get a tiny one so I can use the elevator and make it easier for me to reach a room with all my luggages. really Bad experience,, I paid 200 a day for this SH,, I would Pay only 160 at Bellagio LAS VEGAS and get the best service in stars hotel,,,better than this hotel charlesMark. dont book this hotel Pals in case u have other options. Good: location"
Bad: Size of room. Good: Leaving
"Bad: I don't really know why this hotel has such a high rating. It's decent, but definitely not worth 3* and 300+ I paid for the room. Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking."
"Bad: Nothing to dislike awesome stay. Good: Really liked the modern feel to the place ! Nice looking spot, so I kinda look like a bum when I travel so not to attract crime or Theves . And I usually travel around walking and exploring so I travel light aka bum looking ... the staff was very friendly to me . The room was awesome nice touches classical music playing after a shower and some music I was rejuvenated and went to the bar an had great conversation really a good memory to my trip I'd defiantly stay here again like the small hotel appeal . Great stay ."
"Bad: Price did not fit the size of the room. It felt more like a cubicle. Good: The room was nice and clean, came with safe, and fridge."
Strange drainage smell when entering the reception area Loved the location and friendly staff
Good: great location breakfast
Good: The breakfast was good and the bedroom was comfortable.It was within walking distance of the freedom trail.There was also a shuttle bus to the airport within walking distance.
Bad: Walls are very thin - we could hear upstairs and next door neighbors. The breakfast was very basic. Good: The location was great. Easy access to T. Nice bathroom.
"Bad: Tiny grim, room with a full size bed for my husband and myself which was way too small.If you opened the window ( onto an airshaft) the food smell from the neighboring restaurant were terrible. Good: the location"
Bad: The breakfast was good but there could've been more variety to it. Good: The location was amazing! I also liked the fact that the hotel was very cosy.
"Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great. Would have also preferred tea/coffee in the room rather that the large stereo/DVD system but that's just personal preference. Good: Great location, and friendly staff. Nice bar."
I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet
Good: I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet
"Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean."
Bad: Closest parking was a 4-5 minute walk away for 28 overnight. Closer parking is available for 48 overnight. Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game.
Bad: Bed is too small for two people and the blanket is too thin. The staff are just ok not very friendly though. Good: Location and the New England style building and the room is cute.
Bad: Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed. Bed took up most of the room. Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels. Bathroom was also tiny. Not worth the exhorbitant price at all. Good: Location was good.
"Bad: Heater didn't work, so the room was very cold. Room wifi was crazy slow, so I couldn't use it AT ALL. Staffs were lazy and rude, especially when they call. Good: Location. Center boston"
Good: Bathroom was large and the speakers in the wall
Bad: I didn't like the siE of the rooms cozy but to small. Good: I liked the comfort of a small room the location and the staff that was working there
"Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean. I loved the exposed brick throughout the halls, and that actual keys are given out, not key cards. Great location and staff."
"Bad: Too pricy, very basic for what you pay for. Good: Nice staff, good continental breakfast included. Excellent location."
Bad: Room too small. Late check in at 15:00. Good: Excellent location and the staff was super polite. WiFi was working good. Check out at 12:00 was very convenient for me. Storage area provided.close by the center with all lot of coffees and bars around.
"One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices."
Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs.
Bad: Breakfast - hardly adequate. Good: Location and value for that location. Easy to get to - right across from bus station to/from Logan airport. Room was small but comfortable and updated.
"Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building."
Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.
Bad: breakfast is normal. Good: I am very satisfied this hotel.
Bad: Breakfast is very poor. Good: Room was very comfortable. Ideally positionned.
"Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future"
"Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life"
"Bad: Super slow wifi, Comcast kept getting stuck and I would have to wait about 45 seconds just for the channel to change - wish there's was at least oatmeal for breakfast. Good: Location - room - clean - right in front of public library of Boston"
"Bad: The room was very small and dark. Bathroom was large. The window faced an alleyway. Good: Amazing location and great price, clean room and nice staff."
Too expensive for what offered Location and staff
Good: Fantastic location right near Copley Square and directly above marathon finish line.
"Bad: Wifi strength not great for end room. Good: Staff, location, rooms"
Bad: Breakfast.
Bad: Very minimal breakfast. Good: Great location.
"Good: staff was very friendly and accommodating, hotel perfectly located for travelers"
"Bad: More comfortable seating in the breakfast area. Good: Excellent location, really convenient for exploring Boston and close to the underground for travelling to the airport. Comfortable room and convenient breakfast facilities."
"Bad: Poor breakfast. Good: Good location, good design, comfortable room."
Good: Lovely room and bathroom. The lady on reception was very helpful and friendly. We would stay here again.
"Good: Bar had a good atmosphere, room was really cute."
Bad: The pillows were flat. Good: It was a great location close to everything. The bathroom was newly remodeled and beautiful! The bed was average but I got good night's sleep.
Bad: The room was right off the elevator so you could hear everyone coming off of it. Good: The bathroom was very nice. The shower has great water pressure and the shower head is adjustable.
"Bad: The parking garage was farther than we thought, was inconvenient but realize its a city and parking is always difficult. I would of liked valet service and would of paid more happily for it. Good: Yes it's small put clearly stated and really set up well. Was very fresh and updated not to mention clean. Would defiantly stay here again on our next visit. The staff in the evening was very efficient and helpful."
"Bad: Breakfast was inadequate, no protein. Small bathroom. No luggage cart. Good: Location and discount parking. Clean with nice staff. Near subway station and Newbury St. with lots of good restaurants within walking distance."
Good: Loved the sound system in the room and the fact that they have coffee all the time!
"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location."
Bad: sheets seemed unwashed and old item from previous occupant was still in closet.
Bad: Breakfast was not very large for the price of the hotel. Good: Everything about this place was great!
"Bad: The room was really small. With two large suitcases, we could hardly move in it. Good: Location, staff, bar with complimentary drinks"
Good: An excellent concierge.He thought through problems and gave you an informed choice of solutions.
"Bad: Room size, bed size and breakfast. Good: Location is very good"
Everything was perfect
Bad: Small room. Good: Location location ! Easy Check in And our
"Bad: Breakfast was slim pickings. No cereal or toast. No yoghurt. Only bagels with unrefrigerated cream cheese and quick oats porridge. Don't go for the breakfast. Good: Great room, clean and a comfortable."
Cozy room and vibe to this place... many food options close by.. minutes from Fenway Park and the house of blues
"Bad: Complimentary breakfast. Good: Location was great, right where we wanted to see some attractions. Free breakfast was a little misleading, (just say appetizers, and fruit basket). But overall, would definitely recommend, and stay again. Staff was good, and room was quiet."
Good: Coffee and juice were nice to start out the day with! Cold cereal would have been a plus.
Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient location in the city centre walkable to most attractions
"Bad: Breakfast can be better. Its very simple, I had to go out and seek for a real breakfast because the hotel option was not attractive at all. Good: Very good location. Our room was good, you get what you pay, anything more."
Good: Staff was wonderful! The location perfect. Nice breakfast
"Bad: Breakfast was a little sparse but was as advertised. Good: Nice room, small but cozy."
"Bad: The room we stayed in has a window was facing an alley. We were woken up at 3 am by the garbage truck and they were there until 5.30 AM picking trash from the entire alley, not a good idea for light sleepers. The hotel should invest a bit in better soundproof windows. Good: Good spread of breakfast. Friendly staff Great shower and toiletries"
Nothing to complain about Everything was fine and week with the price. It is very central in Boston and close to the public transportation.
Good: Excellent location
"Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: It's economical, boutique style (my fave), great quality in an A+ location for Boston visitors."
"Bad: No hot water in the morning. Poor choice for breakfast - very little that was healthy. Good: Great location, nice room."
"Bad: It's not a negative per se but, breakfast could be more widely selective. But what was there was absolutely fantastic. Good: We were super-well accommodated, the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Location is great, and even on a loud street you couldn't here a thing."
Bad: Tempeture control. Fan was not automatic. Had to manually turn off and on. not a deal breaker. Good: Location and staff. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. We arrived a few hours before check in and they held our luggage while we explored the area. Lots of shopping an dinner choices close by. T was 2 minutes away. Room was nice.
"Good: continental breakfast was great - and length of time offered was excellent. 24 hour desk personnel was a special plus and very helpful - at any hour. location is excellent - nothing better for shopping, restaurants, public transportation, sightseeing, etc. Close to everything you visit Boston for and great staff plus affordable."
"Good: Location, location, location"
Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient location in the city centre walkable to most attractions
"Bad: Bed was a bit hard. Breakfast was all carbs, but was better than nothing. Good: Great location, right near two T stops and directly across from the Boston Public Library. Super nice staff. Great bar downstairs. Great price. We loved having music speakers overhead in main room and bathroom. Roomy, hot shower with great water pressure. Free continental breakfast with good coffee."
"Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most."
Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay.
Bad: Pool close too early. Should be stay availble all the time overnight. Good: Room cleanness and staff
"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel."
"Good: The room was lovely and spacious, bed very comfy. Staff changed our bed every day and fresh towels. We could not have been better looked after by manager Lewis. Events organizers Ricardo and John were great help for tours."
"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind"
"Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean. Valet parking was very fast (39/d), staff was friendly. Also the roomservice was fast and delicious."
Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there
Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great.
"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again."
"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu."
"When you read the information about Lenore, believe it. She is the bright and shining asset to this hotel. The staff are very personable and helpful. The rooms definitely need some upgrading. The location however is wonderful."
"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!"
"The staff was very helpful and friendly! Lenore was awesome! She delivered a bottle of champagne for our anniversary! Our ocean view room was wonderful and we are looking forward to staying again once the renovation is completed!The rooms were clean, but need some upgrading--But we were only in the room to sleep so it really didn't bother us...The mini fridge came in handy as well as the ABC Market a few steps away. Subway, Coldstone, Wolfgang Puck's are two minutes away walking...Sushi place within 5 minutes walking!!! McDonald's Burger King within 3 minutes walking...Check out the Pacific Hotel for some awesome cuisine and a huge aquarium!Thanks for making our 4th of July fun....Hey, everyone, don't forget to pick up the Entertainment Book for Hawaii...We saved a lot on Parasailing, Hiking, Snorkeling, Restaurants, Pearl Harbor, etc...Great two for one offers! I got mine on Ebay!"
"The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend."
"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed."
The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations.
"I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)"
"The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs."
"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu."
"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!"
"I really like the trip to Hawaii, and I think that everybody in the hotel was really nice to us in every think, the rooms were really clean, the breakfast were good too, and all the people help me when I had a question. I would come to the same hotel if I'll return to Hawaii. It was a really good experience.Ana"
"Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience.

"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!"
"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!"
"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT"
"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel."
"Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!"
"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area."
"I have stayed at the hotel several times over many years (while it was The Carlton). I am SO Very excited about this hotel for so many reasons. While I know there has been some challenges with renovations, I wish people would not get hung...More"
"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly."
"It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last! From check in to check out we were treated courteously, even at the restaurant/bar where we had fun drinking fun drinks. Our room was beautiful...so NOLA and the marble bathroom and shower was perfect...LOVE Bienville House!!!"
"Bad: nothing. Good: Location is perfect. Near to the beach, resturants, lounge bar, etc. the room is good and clean."
"Bad: The mini bars are basic. I mean... if that's the only thing I can think of ...then this place is amazing. Good: Everything was perfect. Friendly staff, wonderful location, and they even had a whole setup with lounges on the beach that I was unaware of that was just perfect, too."
Bad: a pool would be a plus.the bathroom was too little. Good: the room was comfortable and excellent location. Good value for the money
Bad: Poor sound isolation in rooms. Good: Close to most attractions
"Bad: I didnt like being charged daily fees for the beach/pool when I never used them. Good: I was incorrectly being charged for the previous guests breakfast, its a good thing I checked my bill. I liked that the complaint was immediately checked and the bill promptly rectified."
"Good: From the room, to the staff to the location.....this hotel has it all... and who doesnt like breakfast that is served until noon....i was a little worried at first, because i couldnt believe the deal we got for a hotel in SoBe....but everything was just PERFECT...."
Good: The staff was fantastic and amazingly helpful.
"Bad: Was a bit pricey, but may be that was the season and the timing (March 17, it was a music festival at Miami Beach). Good: Very clean and stylish. Very helpful staff."
"Good: Courtesy, friendliness of employees. Perfect location."
"Good: Best Location SouthBeach, nice staff!"
"Good: Great location on Ocean Drive. Room and amenities were nice and comfortable. Nice lounge, bar area. Very nice and helpful staff. Bathroom a bit tight but fine."
"Bad: Construction next door. Good: Big front porch, short walk to beach"
Good: Very friendly staff. Rental of a beach chair and umbrella was included in the room price.
"Bad: Only down side was the breakfast as hot choices were always overcooked splitting hairs as a coffee drinker would say coffee was awful. But you have perfectly good diner 2 block away so no big deal. Good: Location, rooms, front Terrace and great staff plus the hotel was super clean and well presented. Will definitely be back. Not forgetting beach towels provided and sun loungers on the beach."
Bad: Nothing!. Good: The hotel staff were very nice. The location of the Hotel is perfect. Its right at the beach and you even get a couple chairs and an umbrella.
"Good: Staff and service was very friendly and helpfull. Hotel is nice, location is nice."
"Bad: The bedsheeet was not really clean when we checked in. Good: Nice location, and I loved the bed so much it was so comfortable. The receptionists were really helpful and friendly."
"Good: The breakfast was fantastic as we partying late in Miami Beach and we were able to have our brekkie up until 12 noon! Also, the staff were all very friendly!"
"Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows."
"Bad: Small rooms for American standards. Could have been cleaner. Towels were dirty. Average standard hotel, not as good as expected. Good: Very good location, one block from the beach (2 min walk). 3 min to Ocean Drive/Lummus Park, 5 min to Nikki Beach Club. Chairs and umbrellas on the beach from an external provider from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm included. Towels are provided. Valet parking 35 for 24h, no overnight street parking (day 4/h)."
"Bad: The bathroom toilet area is tight. Would not probably be comfortable for larger person. You can hear through walls bit isn't much of an issue as probably will not be in room most of time. Good: Great location to beach and bars/restaurants. Convenient beach service as related to provided towel, chair, and umbrella service. Very good happy hour prices as related to that areas prices."
Bad: The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min then 30 min for my vehicle to arrive. Twice the excuse given was the ticket inside vehicle was wrong.
Bad: THE BATHROOM WAS ON THE SMALL SIDE...PROBLEMS CONTINUALLY WITH THE TV / CABLE RECEPTION...HAD TO CHANGE ROOMS ON MY 3RD NIGHT BECAAUSE THE AC WENT OUT...VERY ANNOYED ABOUT THAT..BUT...OH WELL...
Good: Location is just excellent! And the fact that they provide you included sunbed at the beach!
Bad: There was loud music playing at night and in the morning. Luckily I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't really bother me. Good: Great location in Miami Beach (south). Close to all the action but off the main stretch so it's more peaceful. Near to lots of shops. There was an issue with our room and we had to spend one night in their sister hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to make sure we were comfortable. The hotel offers a portable wifi hotspot for guests to take out with them - very cool!
"Bad: Its not something i didn't like, its more like a recommendation since its not something quite important, and actually i don't know if other rooms have it but particularly my room didn't have a big mirror other than the one in the bathroom. Also, i think breakfast can be maybe until 11:30am, like other restaurants or hotel provide, more like a brunch style and serve more options. Good: Really modern hotel, very very clean room almost like if we were the first to use it, excellent staff. We arrived at 10am approximately since our flight was early in the morning and they managed to give us an available room. hotel is at an excellent location since its ocean drive but not at the crowded noisy part so we could party, and still be able to rest and sleep well!"
Bad: Uncomfortable beds. Good: Location
"Bad: the only thing i found not 100 great was the low water pressure in the shower. Good: i love everything about the hotel really. it's just 2 blocks off the beaten track in a very quiet, ye central area of south beach. came during art basel so prices were of course high, but still reasonable"
Bad: Bathroom a bit small. Good: Good hotel. Close to beach and bars and restaurants. Good staff
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient to airport, great staff, lovely decor."
"Bad: The bathroom was extremely tiny although had a good sized shower. Good: The location was excellent being a short stroll to a beautiful beach, near the historic art deco buildings and many good restaurants. The bedroom was large with a very comfortable bed. Interesting , different artwork throughout the hotel. Good variety of food at breakfast"
Bad: room 222 is directly below the fitness center and it gets very loud when someone is on the treadmill. Good: Devon at the front desk was a phenomenal host! He went above and beyond to make our stay great!
"Bad: Air conditioning wasn't working when we arrived, but the maintenance person fixed it. Good: Location friendly staff."
Bad: paying extra for Valet Parking. Good: The Kings room
Bad: You can hear everything we could even hear folks snoring in the next room!!!!!. Good: Location
"Good: Room was lovely, shower was great, staff were friendly and very helpful. Bed was comfortable and the room was really quiet"
Bad: Expensive but all of south beach is. . Good: Location
Good: The serviceminded staff in the reception (specially Maria)
Bad: Small rooms Poor and overprized breakfast. Good: Great location
"Bad: As others have commented the Valet Parking at 35 per day is steep however it is known before you sign up to it, there is a parking lot close by that only charges 15 per day although not sure what they would charge if you wanted to leave overnight. Good: Very good location on Ocean Drive but away from the noise of the main area. Breakfast was ideal, plenty of choice and had the added bonus available until noon Rooms were clean and tidy and we did not find them small and we had two large suitcases in each as well as other hand luggage. Staff always acknowledged you"
"Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!"
"Bad: Delays in checkin, no liquor license yet!. Good: Location room"
"Bad: very small room and bathroom, noisy AC. Good: excellent staff and service, very friendly and accommodating, good location on Ocean Drive"
"Good: Location. Peace and quiet. Breakfast good, nice bar."
Bad: Hotel tried to charge extra for change in tax. Had a difficult time during check in because of this factor. Room was very small for three people to stay in. Good: Hotel was clean and close to everything in south beach.
Bad: The room is very small. The footstep sound from other room can be heard. The wifi is too weak. Good: What I really like is the location and decorations. It only takes 5 minutes to beach.
Bad: I stayed at this hotel for 2 days..they asked me to pay 100 deposit even though I did not know that I had to spit this money before booking the room I finally agreed and in good faith and i paid I was told that the money will be returned back to my account within 7 working daysand so it was done for 1 month and the money I did not get back.
"Bad: quite a bit of noise from the upstairs 'neighbors.' They could do better with soundproofing... also, the breakfast was a bit weak. Eggs overcooked, somewhat tasteless and kind of cold, no specialty coffee drinks available and not much for healthy options. if you have a car, beware that for all intents and purposes the valet parking is required, and will run an extra 35/night. Good: lovely decor, super friendly and helpful bilingual staff. Bed was comfortable and the shower was good."
Bad: service and staffs are not fully trained and don t smile. Good: location
"Bad: The facility is normal and so many people held parties at night, so you may not wanna stay there if you are seeking a place where is relaxing and quiet. Good: Staffs are friendly and the location is good"
Good: Ideal location for South Beach.
Bad: Invoicing of non used items after leaving the hotel.
Bad: The small breakfast was offered at an additional cost. It had limited items for a vegetarian diet. Good: I was impressed with the complementary robes and slippers and not to mention the decor is as beautiful in person as it is online!
Bad: The staff never changed the sheets and I was there 4 nights. No microwave or refrig. Good: I like it was a min from the beach
Good: I really liked the water in the lobby.
"Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff."
"Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!"
Bad: Room size. Good: Location
Good: Amazing hotel.good location.very clean.friendly staff.
Good: Clean and nice room with comfortable bed. Really friendly staff. This hotel is my favourite in Miami Beach.
"Bad: Rooms are a little compact, but that had little impact on our stay!. Good: Location was excellent and the price was very reasonable compared to other properties. Staff were all amazing."
Good: can't wait to stay here again!
Bad: everything ok. Good: all good
Good: It was a great location and had amazing decor.
"Bad: There was nothing I did not like. Good: Art Deco, location, price, and bed...."
Bad: Was told I would get a robe and didn't.
Bad: Spa wasn't available. Good: Staff are exceptional and very friendly
"Bad: Car was freshly washed before we arrived to valet the car. 3 days later, the car was filled with hard water marks from the sprinklers and now we need to get the car detailed to remove the spots. A bit frustrating to not get the car back in the same condition... Good: Location great, staff was pleasant, buffet was good and the chef that made the omelet was amazing"
"Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line."
"Bad: Nothing!. Good: 1.Great location, although 1 block back from the strip it is very central and perhaps better than staying on the strip to the far left or right. 2. Value for money for the size and comfort of the room 3. Short walk from hotel room to lobby entry unlike most mega hotels in Vegas 4. Small bar/casino across the road with 1 beer... unheard of on the strip"
"Bad: I booked a room with city view but they said the only view is of the wheel. Good: The staff were helpful, comfortable beds and location."
Bad: I was overcharged at the property and after two requests to front desks no one got back to me. The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable
Bad: Pre-paid for a premium room with two double beds but was given a disability access room with a king bed. .
Bad: View from room over car park. Good: Great location just off the main strip near Caesars Palace. Room comfortable and staff helpful. Allowed us to have a late check out at no extra cost.
"Bad: The first room - AC not working. No hot water in bathroom. The second room - was not totally cleaned. Leftover shampoo, conditioner, and soap were found in tub area. AC is noisy."
"Good: Structure, room"
"Good: Excellent location, clean interior, very good staff. Easy check in/out. Free parking where the nearby hotels charge for parking even if you stay there."
"Good: Didnt smell like smoke, and no gambling"
"Bad: They cannot find my booking ticket when I arrived, and the girl who serve us went to have joke with others, let us wait for her for a long time. Mini bar is empty."
Bad: No pool. The Breakfast room was not appealing. The buffet was limited. Good: The heavenly beds
"Bad: The elevator was tricky to use as you had to insert your room key which didn't always work. The front desk never mentioned it either so I had to figure it out on my own. Good: The location was great. The room was basic but still nice and clean. The pool was low key, perfect for relaxing."
Bad: Restaurant was bad. Good: Thank God for the Starbucks
Bad: More restaurants. Good: Very friendly staff.
Bad: No my experience was horrible it was a bad experience frome the moment we arrived to the moment we left. I had 6 rooms reserved 2 were canceled by hotel then when we asked questions the manager decides to to rais his voice at us to the point everyone on line to check in and around tje aria was able to here what was going on. My guest were unhappy they traveled from sacramento to vegas a 9 hour drive to vet bad service. Then vale was horrible my sisters car was broken into while on possession of vale instead of helping they yelled at her and dint help her. Ontop of that all my guest and I were separated and it was hard to meet up in my room they elevaters only alow access to your floor not others. Good: .

Good: Great stay for short stay.
"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip."
Bad: The toilet in our room blocked couple times. Good: Great location and free parking! Less than 5 mins walk to the strip.
Bad: The phone receiver didn't work. And the room wouldn't get as cold as I like. Good: I love my stay at the Westin.
Good: Friendly staff. Every thing was perfect.
Good: I loved everything
"Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable."
Bad: Check-in process as staff was deceptive and misleading as to when we could check-in. Others around us were equally upset with the dishonesty. Good: Great price through Booking.com. Room was clean and bed comfortable.
"Good: I was mistakenly booked the wrong date to extend my stay using Booking.com. However, the receptionist, Ms. Lynn, very helpful by giving a call to Booking.com and finally be able to change the date."
"Bad: Difficult to reach reservation staff (no tollfree number, nobody answering phone during business hours, long waits on hold), inflexibility in changing a reservation a week in advance, not enough towels, toilet too low and tub too high. A bit pricey... Good: Location, quality of free toiletries"
"Bad: Our toilet overflowed at 1am and the water wouldn't stop. When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch."
Good: The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The location is away from the congestion of the strip but easily accessible. The Westin will be my first and only option when staying in Vegas.
"Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all"
Bad: quiet off the strip but close enough to walk. Good: beds were very comfortable
Bad: Nothing. Good: Quieter compared to the strip hotels
Bad: Hotel was under a major renovation n there is no casino n no restaurants within the hotel. Ice machine was broken on our floor. You have to have key access to get ice from other floors but no access ever given. We had to ask 6 times for keys! They wouldn't work at all! Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way. Good: Beds we're comfy
"Bad: 25 resort fee when we did not use the facilities. Good: Clean,comfortable, location and clean"
"Bad: Buffet Break fast was not to the standard of Westin. Small casino Worst of all away from Strip, which was not described well by booking.com when booking hotel......... Only one small restaurant. Good: Staff was very courteous."
